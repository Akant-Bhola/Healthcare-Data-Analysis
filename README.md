This project analyses healthcare billing data using Apache Spark in Databricks, focusing on patient demographics, medical conditions and treatment costs. The analysis aims to uncover trends and relationships between various medical conditions and their associated billing amounts across different insurance providers. The project includes data extraction, transformation and cleaning, followed by detailed visualisations to highlight key insights, illustrating how data analysis can enhance decision-making in healthcare management.
